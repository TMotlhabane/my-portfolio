        First of all, I will want to say a big thank you to Matt and his team for this great opportunity that was given
        to not
        just me but billions of other women out there I really appreciate. It was really a great time being a student of
        this
        great foundation. This has been the most wonderful experience that I've ever had, thank you Matt and She Codes
        team! I
        never though I can code in my entire life. I thought coding was for men! But you have made me realize that this
        coding
        thing is possible and anyone can do it. I am considering doing it until I become a pro! Matt is a wonder
        instructor who
        makes coding easy!


        Matt and the SheCodes team make it so easy to learn and grow my confidence. I had such a fun time designing and
        developing my portfolio and I feel like I can take these skills and use them to build a career. I'm so excited
        for the
        next set of classes where I can further elevate my codes and projects.
